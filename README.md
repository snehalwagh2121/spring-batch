# SPRING BATCH

##TASKLETS

Tasklets are used in projects where there is a need to process the data and not to read/write into a file.
Although we can read and write into a file, but it will be done in one transaction. So if any issues come with just one record, we would have to run the batch job for the whole data.
Also, it is majorly used when we are dealing with small records.
